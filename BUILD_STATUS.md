# BUILD STATUS

## 2026-04-15

- Completed: Defined a stable PRD CLI output contract for `validate` and `inspect` with explicit, documented fields used by both text and `--json` output.
- Completed: Added deterministic human-readable section ordering and consistent unknown-command failure behavior for the limited command surface (`pack`, `validate`, `inspect`).
- Completed: Expanded CLI tests to cover missing-argument usage errors, exit code behavior (`0` valid / `1` invalid), expected JSON key presence, and deterministic text section ordering.
